# GELP-TTS
The first open source implementation of a GELP-based text-to-speech system.

This Text-To-Speech system is intended to sound as natural as a Corpus-TTS with the added flexibility of being able to modify the glottal parameters. This allows you to customize the TTS voice by just retraining it with the desired parameters instead of getting new training data from an actual person with the target voice. Hence, this TTS is suitable for a wide range of applications since it allows for highly customization with little effort.

This was my final project for Speech Processing at UGR on January 2018, hence the code is fully written in Spanish since I was forced to do so. Note that this is a testbed so no project hierarchy is maintained. This code was developed to test the algorithm that I created and hence it is not intended to be deployable to production yet. A fully functional and documented Python version might come this summer.
